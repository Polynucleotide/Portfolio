# Portfolio - Systems & Game Development

I'm a third-year computer science student with a focus on performance-critical, real-time systems in C++.  
My work spans engine and game development, and low-level systems, emphasizing memory efficiency, low-latency,  
high-throughput, and high-throughput.

This portfolio highlights projects demonstrating both **memory-efficient, high-performance systems**, and **game development** skills.
